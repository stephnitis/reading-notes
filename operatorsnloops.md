### [Expressions & Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

**Types of Operators in JavaScript:**

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

- JavaScript has both *binary* and *unary* operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. 
- A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator e.g. : **operand1 operator operand2**
- A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator e.g. : **operator operand** or **operand operator**

**Assignment Operators:**

- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. There are also compound assignment operators.
- If a variable refers to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable.
