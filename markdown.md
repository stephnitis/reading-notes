### [Basic Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

- To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
- Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.
- You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.
- To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
- Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
- To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
- To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
- To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.
- To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
- To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
- Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.
- To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
- To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).
- To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.
- To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.
