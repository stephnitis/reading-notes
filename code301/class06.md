### 1. What is node.js?

  It is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine and enhanced with various features such as a file system API, and HTTP library and a number of operating system related utility methods.

### 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

  It is a free, open-source JavaScript engine (which is a software component that executes JavaScript code) developed for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers.

### 3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

  A JavaScript runtime refers to where your JavaScript code is executed when you run it. It provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.

### 4. What is npm?

  It is a package manager, which is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner. It is also the world's largerst software registry

### 5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

  It allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can thus be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system and everything else required to build fully functional applications.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### 1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### 2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

In my experience I have found it very beneficial to learn from fellow students, as they have different experiences and problem solve in different ways. It can be really helpful to view the problem through a different lens as well as to learn various things from one another.

### 3. How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

  - The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
  - The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
