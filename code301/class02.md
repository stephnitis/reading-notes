# Sate and Props

## [React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

*React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.*

### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

**`render`**

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

**`constructor()`**

### Put the following things in the order that they happen:

  1. `constructor`
  2. `render`
  3. `componentDidMount`
  4. `React Updates`
  5. `componentWillUnmount`

### What does `componentDidMount` do?

The `componentDidMount()` method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.
