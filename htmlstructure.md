### [An Intro to Wireframing](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)

**Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.**
- a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
- Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

**Why use wireframes?**
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

**6 Steps to make a Wireframe:**
1. Do your research
    - Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
    - Scribble a cheatsheet with your your requirements, your personas, use cases, and perhaps some reminders of the coolest features you stumbled across in your competitor research.
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
   - Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self-sufficient, lower levels of user frustration, and therefore lower drop-off or drop-out rates.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
    - *Remember: you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in mighty fine detail.*
    - How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
    - Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
    - What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
    - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?
5. Add some detail and get testing
    - Add detail in the way you would naturally process a screen, or the page of a book: from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. *Remember: Your wireframe is the skeleton of your site.*
    - Think about:
        - Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
        - Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
        - Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
        - Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
    **Once you’ve done all that, you’re ready for your first user tests.**
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
    - Once you’ve documented and acted upon the feedback from your first prototype, you can start developing your high-fidelity prototypes.

**How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles**
1. Clarity
    - Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs
2. Confidence
    - Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand.
3. Simplicity is key
    - Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals.
