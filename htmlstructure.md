### [An Intro to Wireframing](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)

**Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.**
- a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
- Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

**Why use wireframes?**
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.
