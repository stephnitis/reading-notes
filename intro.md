## Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### Introduction

**How the Web Works**

- People access websites using software called *web browsers*
- When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the internet to a special computer known as a *web server* that hosts the site.
- People access the web via various devices (laptops, tablets mobile phones) & it is important to remember that these have varying screen sizes and connection speeds.
- *Screen readers* are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.
- When you look at a website your browser is typically receiving HTML & CSS from the web server that hosts the site

### Chapter 1: Structure

- HTML Pages are text documents
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give information the surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they, and where they can go.
