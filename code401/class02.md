# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

### 1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

It is software which lies between an operating system and the applications that are running on it. Allowing communication and acting as a bridge between the system/database and applications.

### 2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.

Node Web Framework

### 3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

The framework is flexible, and allows you to handle tasks how you choose. You can insert almost any compatible middleware that you like into the request handling chain, in whatever order you like. The app can be structured however you choose.

### 4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's `require()` function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.

Modularity is useful as it allows you to organie your code into manageable parts. **"a monolithic single-file application is hard to understand and maintain. Using modules also helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly export are imported when you use a module."**

## [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)

### 1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

### 2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

## [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

### 1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

### 2. What are three expected benefits of testing

### 3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

## [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

### 1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

### 2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

### 3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
