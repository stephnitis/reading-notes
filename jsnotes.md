### [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
- The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
  - Store useful values inside variables.
  - Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
  - Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.

- **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
