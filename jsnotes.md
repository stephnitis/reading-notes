### [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
- The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
  - Store useful values inside variables.
  - Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
  - Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.

### [JavaScript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)

- **Variables** are containers for storing data (storing data values).
- There are 4 ways to declare a JS Variable:
  - Using **var**
  - Using **let**
  - Using **const**
  - Using nothing
- The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
- The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
- If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
- If you want a general rule: always declare variables with **const**.
- If you think the value of the variable can change, use **let**.
- Just like in algebra, variables hold values
- Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions
- **Variables are containers for storing values.**

- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called **identifiers**.
  - Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

- **The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:**
  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  - Names must begin with a letter
  - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

- In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
- *The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.*

- JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
- In programming, text values are called text strings.
- Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. **If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.**

- Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
- You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword
- After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
- To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign
- You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it
- **It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.**
- You can declare many variables in one statement. Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma.

**Value = undefined:**

- In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
- A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined
