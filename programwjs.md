### [Control Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

- **Control Flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
- A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### [JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it):
  - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
  - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
  - Automatically (self invoked)
