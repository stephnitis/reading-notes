# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML&CSS by Jon Ducket

### Chapter 2: Text

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information, which provides extra information that is not intended to affect the structure of the page (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
- When the browser comes across line breaks or two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. This is known as *white space collapsing.*

### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like)
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## JavaScript & JQuery by Jon Ducket

### Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or fales).
-Expressions evaluate into a single value.
-Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (`===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>`) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- `if...else` statements allow you to run one set of code if a condtion is true and another if it is false
- `switch` statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provide a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy
- There are three types of loop: `for, while,` and `do...while.` Each repeats a set of statements.
