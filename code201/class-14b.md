- Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

- The most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions on lunch breaks
- the best managers have good communication skills and avoid micromanaging

#### Project Aristotle

- **Norms** are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function together 
- Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals, but when they gather, the groups norms typically override individual proclivities.
- Researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the key to improving teams
- how teammates treat each other is key

**Important factors:**

- **Equality in distribution of conversational turn taking** means as long as everyone gets a chance to talk, the team does well
- **High average social sensitivity** means being skilled at intuiting how others feel based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other non-verbal cues
- a sense of confidence thatthe team will not embarass, reject or punish someone for speaking up / a climate of interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves

- psychological safety and emotions are related: conversational turn-taking and empathy are part of the unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we are trying to establish a bond

- no one wants to put on a "work face" or leave part of their personality or inner life at home
- to be "fully present" at work, to feel "psychologically safe" we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations: we must be able to talk about what is messy or sad/to have hard conversations with colleagues.
