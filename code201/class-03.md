## HTML & CSS by Jon Ducket

### Chapter 3: Lists

- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition
- Ordered lists use numbers
- Unordered lists use bullets
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another

### Chapter 13: Boxes

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margins and padding for each box with CSS
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### Chapter 4: Decisions & Loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators ( `===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>` ) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- `if...else` statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- `switch` statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsey.
- There are 3 types of loop: `for, while` and `do...while.` Each repeats a set of statements.
