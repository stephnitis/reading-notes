### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**How does it Work?**

- While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
  - The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
  - The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.

**Why? Because there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:**

- **Listening** hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
- **Speaking** using the correct words to communicate an idea
- **Reading** understanding what written language intends to convey
- **Writing** producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution

**Other benefits:**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
