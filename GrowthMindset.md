### [The Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

- **Growth Mindset** believes that one's fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.
- **Fixed Mindset** believes that intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
- *Embrace Challenges* by recognizing avoidance, walking through the problem bit by bit and looking for new ways to think about it.
- Recognize the *"gumption trap"* which is the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it, make peace with this and work through it by taking a break or committing to one small piece of the work.
- Make conscious choices to put forth the effort needed despite the temptations of instant gratification
- *Embrace Criticism* as a means of improvement, and take the time to review and assess the best and worst aspects of your work in order to progress further going forward.
- *Use the success of others as inspiration* and recognize how together as a team their unique skillsets compliment your own.
