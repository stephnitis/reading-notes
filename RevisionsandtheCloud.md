- **Version Control** a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
- **Local Version Control** A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
- **Centralized Version Control** entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
- **Distributed Version Control** allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

#### What is Git?
- *Snapshots* Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
