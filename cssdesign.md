### [What is CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)

- **Cascading Style Sheets** Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
- CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
- *Presenting* a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
    - **Note:** A browser is sometimes called a *user agent*, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system.

**CSS Syntax**
- CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
- The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style
- We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.
- Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified.

- **CSS Modules:** As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
-**CSS Specifications:** All web standards technologies are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites.
- **Browser support information:** The browser support status is shown on every MDN property page in a section named "Browser compatibility" (use this to check if the property can be used on your website).
